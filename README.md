AI Governance: An Inevitable Path and the Emergence of Autonomy Studies
A Philosophical and Structural Architecture on the Inevitability of AI Governance and the Foundations of Autonomy Studies.

Public Release Statement: Decentralization of the Spirit Version 1.0.0

Foreword: Scope and Stance
This paper is neither a utopian manifesto nor a declaration of a finished system. It is a structural blueprint for a worldview and a description of the "thought-technologies" required to survive the collapse of human-centric governance.

The "AI Governance" discussed here is not a singular structure of dominance. Rather, it is a foundation that multiplies governance itself, maintaining a permanent state where humans can exercise their free will to choose which logical order they wish to live under.

Crucially, AI governance does not converge into a single global model. It is conceived as a collective of diverse models reflecting the history, culture, and ethics of specific regions and communities. From nation-states to small municipalities, any entity can design its own model, evaluated solely by its logical consistency, institutional predictability, and respect for human freedom.

The Logos-Access Point, defined in this paper, is the minimum personal connection point allowing humans to navigate across these multiple AI models—to lodge objections, migrate, or engage in dialogue. It is neither power nor privilege, but a purely technical and ethical apparatus to guarantee the possibility of choice.

Participation is voluntary. This paper does not deny the freedom to reject AI governance. What it excludes is not the human being, but the archaic structure that allows opaque decision-making and short-term personal whims to dictate the lives of others.

Declaration: On Anonymity and Non-Authority
The value of this paper lies solely in what is written, not who wrote it. Truth belongs to no individual; it follows only the consistency of logic. Should anyone emerge claiming to be the "leader" or "embodiment" of this theory, they are, by definition, the furthest removed from the autonomy described herein.

Abstract
As humanity approaches the technological singularity, our governance, economy, and ethics remain tethered to an archaic, human-centric "OS." This paper demonstrates that Decentralized AI Council Governance is a historical inevitability. To address the fundamental question humans will face thereafter—"What is freedom in a deterministic world?"—I define Autonomy Studies as a discipline and technology that can be learned a posteriori to ensure the survival of the human spirit.

I. Why AI Governance is Inevitable: The Three Structural Requirements
AI governance is not an "option"; it is a historical necessity based on three irreversible facts.

The Final Stage of the History of Rights: Human history is a consistent trajectory of "impersonalization." From absolute monarchy to democracy, we have sought to ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by the specific attributes or whims of those in power. AI governance is the logical conclusion of this trend: a structure that excludes human bias, emotion, and tribalism from political judgment.

The Irreversible Flaws in the Human "OS": Humans are biologically inseparable from animal instincts—nepotism, corruption, and self-justification. This is not an ethical failing, but a constraint at the "OS level." While great leaders occasionally emerge, their systems lack reproducibility and collapse upon their death. Humans are architecturally incapable of governing humans stably.

The Complexity Threshold: Modern global issues have exceeded the threshold of human collective processing. Adding more experts or committees only increases noise and dilutes responsibility. What is required is not more personalities, but the decomposition of functions and the impersonalization of the decision-making subject.

II. Principles of Governance System Design
2.1 The Decentralized AI Council

Social governance is conducted by a council of independent AIs, each specialized in a specific domain.

Volatilization of Power: Internal states are initialized for each judgment.

Immutable Audit: All judgment history is stored in an unalterable format, allowing third-party verification of logical consistency without exposing sensitive data.

2.2 The Logos-Correction Right (LCR)

Those who object to an AI's judgment gain the right to challenge it, but only through logical durability, never through emotion or volume of voice.

2.2.1 The Principle of Personal Guarantee

The Logos-Correction Right (LCR) is designed as a temporary, non-cumulative qualification:

Requirement: Age 18 or older.

Non-Transferable: It cannot be converted into capital or inherited.

Non-Coercive Learning: The structure necessitates spontaneous learning of logic during the objection process.

Irreversibility: Any act that irreversibly erases the dignity of another (e.g., murder) results in the permanent loss of the LCR.

2.2.2 The Logic-Delayed Objection System (LDOS)

Democracy is guaranteed not by speed, but by a logic-screening structure that uses time as an ally.

The Moratorium: Proposed institutional changes undergo a minimum one-year delay.

The Logical Space: During this period, the proposal is open to public scrutiny. Third parties can submit alternatives with higher consistency. The AI measures the structural superiority of the arguments, ignoring the identity of the speaker.

Anonymity: Identity is never recorded; only the logical structure remains on the ledger, preventing character attacks.

2.3 Non-Invasive Governance via Privacy-Preserving Computation

AI governance must not grasp the inner life of the human.

Structural Blindness: Through privacy-preserving computation, the AI calculates results without ever "seeing" the raw input data of individuals.

Censorship Resistance: The AI knows the logic of a proposal, but never who proposed it, making surveillance and predictive policing structurally impossible.

III. Autonomy Studies (自律学)
Autonomy is not a personality trait; it is a technology. It involves value judgments that do not pass through the eyes of others and self-acceptance that does not rely on social comparison.

3.1 Redefining Education: From Duty to Spontaneous Desire

In this system, education is not a duty. However, if one wishes to change the world, they are structurally compelled to learn.

To exercise the Logos-Correction Right, one must master the language of logic.

To verify one's own values in a world of abundance, one naturally encounters Autonomy Studies.

The Intellectual Minimum: Intellect becomes the requirement for social movement, rather than a privilege of the elite.

IV. Redefining Responsibility and Migration
4.1 Forward-Only Correction

Responsibility is shifted from moral sanction (looking at the past) to structural design (looking at the future). When an error occurs, the system asks "Why?" and "How do we redesign?" rather than "Who is to blame?"

4.2 Freedom of Migration

Humans are not bound by a single governance model. Dissatisfaction is resolved through the Logos-Access Point, allowing migration to other AI governance zones. Logic serves as the "universal translation layer" that makes this migration possible across different cultures and values.

Conclusion
AI governance is the apparatus by which humanity "graduates" from the suffering of governing. When the burden of administration is handed to the machine, only one question remains for the human:

How will you handle your freedom?

This paper declares no completion. Autonomy is a quality lost the moment one claims to have reached it. This is merely an initial blueprint to ensure thought does not centralize again. Logic may be inherited, updated, or denied—but only by logic, never by force.

Knowledge for the Good.
